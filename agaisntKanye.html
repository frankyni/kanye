			<h3>Why you should hate Kanye!</h3>

			<div>
				<ol>
					<li>He believes he's god. Which isn't a problem however...</li>

					<li>He believes he's Jesus. How can you be both god and Jesus?</li>

					<li>He does not appear on Keeping up with the Kardashians. You're a public figure already there's no harm being on a television show!</li>

					<li>He hates striped scarves. What? Why?</li>

					<li>He hates sports coats with button up shirts, jeans and dress shoes. He also hates them with hoodies. It seems he just really hates sports coats. Sports coats are good!</li>

					<li>He thinks its hard to find love when you're famous. When he married someone who got famous because of a sex-tape.</li>
